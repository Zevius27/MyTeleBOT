If no specific instruction is given, here is a concise and precise response to the questions provided:  

1. **Attempt any FIVE of the following:**
   a) **State any two features of Linux:**
      - Open-source and free to use.
      - Highly customizable and flexible.

   b) **Difference between Time sharing system and Real time system (any 2 points):**
      - **Time Sharing System:**
        - Multiple users share the system resources simultaneously.
        - Focuses on providing fast response time.
      - **Real Time System:**
        - Processes must be completed within a strict time constraint.
        - Used in critical applications like air traffic control.

   c) **State any four services of operating system:**
      - Process management
      - Memory management
      - File system management
      - Security management

   d) **Write the difference between pre-emptive and non-preemptive scheduling:**
      - **Pre-emptive Scheduling:**
        - The operating system can forcibly take control of the CPU from a process.
        - Example: Round Robin scheduling.
      - **Non-preemptive Scheduling:**
        - Once a process is given the CPU, it keeps it until it finishes or yields voluntarily.
        - Example: First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) scheduling.

   e) **Define following terms:**
      - **i) Virtual Memory:**
        - A combination of RAM and hard disk space used by the OS to manage memory.
      - **ii) Paging:**
        - A memory management technique that divides memory into fixed-sized blocks called pages.       

   f) **List any four file attributes and its meaning:**
      - **Name:** The name of the file.
      - **Size:** The size of the file in bytes.
      - **Type:** The file type (e.g., .txt, .pdf).
      - **Created Date:** The date and time when the file was created.

   g) **Define Deadlock:**
      - A situation where two or more processes are blocked forever, waiting for each other to release resources.

2. **Attempt any THREE of the following:**
   a) **Explain different types of system calls:**
      - **Process Control:** Create, terminate, and manage processes.
      - **File Management:** Open, close, read, and write files.
      - **Device Management:** I/O operations for devices.
      - **Information Maintenance:** Get and set system information.

   b) **Draw and explain process control block in detail:**
      - **Process Control Block (PCB):**
        - **Process ID (PID):** Unique identifier for each process.
        - **Process State:** Running, ready, or waiting.
        - **Program Counter (PC):** Address of the next instruction to be executed.
        - **CPU Registers:** Current state of the CPU.
        - **CPU Scheduling Information:** Priority and scheduling details.
        - **Memory Management Information:** Base and limit registers, page tables.
        - **Accounting Information:** CPU usage, time limits.

   c) **State and explain four scheduling criteria:**
      - **CPU Utilization:** Maximizing the use of CPU time.
      - **Throughput:** Number of processes completed per unit time.
      - **Turnaround Time:** Total time from submission to completion.
      - **Response Time:** Time taken to respond to a user request.

   d) **Define fragmentation. Explain Internal and External Fragmentation:**
      - **Fragmentation:**
        - Inefficient use of memory due to non-contiguous allocation.
      - **Internal Fragmentation:**
        - Occurs when fixed-size blocks are allocated, and some space is wasted.
      - **External Fragmentation:**
        - Occurs when enough total memory exists but is fragmented into non-contiguous blocks.

3. **Attempt any THREE of the following:**
   a) **Describe multiprocessor OS with its advantages:**
      - **Multiprocessor OS:**
        - Manages multiple processors to enhance performance.
      - **Advantages:**
        - Increased throughput and efficiency.
        - Fault tolerance and reliability.
        - Better resource utilization.

   b) **Explain different components of operating system:**
      - **Kernel:** Core component that manages hardware and system resources.
      - **Shell:** User interface for interacting with the OS.
      - **File System:** Manages storage and retrieval of data.
      - **Device Drivers:** Software that allows the OS to interact with hardware.
      - **System Utilities:** Tools for system maintenance and diagnostics.

   c) **Explain different types of schedulers:**
      - **Long-term Scheduler:** Allocates processes to the system.
      - **Short-term Scheduler:** Selects which process to run next.
      - **Medium-term Scheduler:** Handles process swapping.

   d) **Explain two level directory structure with table diagram:**
      - **Two Level Directory Structure:**
        - Root directory contains subdirectories.
        - Subdirectories contain files.
      - **Table Diagram:**
        - **Root Directory:**
          - Subdirectory1
          - Subdirectory2
        - **Subdirectory1:**
          - FileA
          - FileB
        - **Subdirectory2:**
          - FileC
          - FileD
